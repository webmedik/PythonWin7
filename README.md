# Unofficial Python Installers for Windows 7 SP1 and Windows Server 2008 R2 SP1

Officially, Python 3.9 and above are not supported on Windows 7 SP1 and Windows Server 2008 R2 SP1. Here, you can obtain unofficial Windows installers that bring back support for these older Windows versions.

*Note:* Windows update KB2533623 must be installed for Python to run. Ensure that your computer is up-to-date via Windows Update. Alternatively, you can manually install update KB3063858, which supersedes KB2533623. Update KB3063858 can be obtained at the following link for [32-bit Windows](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=47409) or [64-bit Windows](https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/download/details.aspx?id=47442).

*Note:* Microsoft C++ Redistributable must be installed [32-bit and 64-bit](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/windows/latest-supported-vc-redist?view=msvc-170)

For each Python version, this repository includes the following.
- 64-bit executable installer (e.g. python-3.9.0-amd64-full.exe)
- 32-bit executable installer (e.g. python-3.9.0-full.exe)
- 64-bit embeddable zip file (e.g. python-3.9.0-embed-amd64.zip)
- 32-bit embeddable zip file (e.g. python-3.9.0-embed-win32.zip)
- 64-bit NuGet package (e.g. python.3.9.0.nupkg)
- 32-bit NuGet package (e.g. pythonx86.3.9.0.nupkg)
- Windows help file (e.g. python390.chm) (3.9 and 3.10 only)

For the more technical among you, these installers were built from the source distributions published at https://www.python.org/downloads/source/, with the following modifications.
- Include the file `api-ms-win-core-path-l1-1-0.dll` in the distribution. This file was obtained from https://github.com/nalexandru/api-ms-win-core-path-HACK and is necessary for Python to run on older Windows versions.
- Create full installers that include debug symbols, debug binaries, and the Universal CRT without needing to download them. For Python 3.13 or higher, include the experimental free-threaded build as well.
- Allow the installer to proceed on Windows 7 SP1 and Windows Server 2008 R2 SP1.
- For Python 3.11 or higher, revert or modify changes to the Python source code that are not compatible with Windows 7 SP1 or Windows Server 2008 R2 SP1.
- Fix a few bugs in the build scripts.

See [Notes.md](Notes.md) for more specific details about how I built these installers and how you may build them yourself.

## NuGet Packages

To install a `.nupkg` package, ensure that you have the [NuGet Command-Line Interface](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/reference/nuget-exe-cli-reference?tabs=windows) installed. Go to the directory containing the `.nupkg` file. Replace `target\installation\directory` in the following commands with the desired location to install the package.

### Command Prompt
For 64-bit Python, run `nuget install python -Source %cd% -OutputDirectory target\installation\directory`

For 32-bit Python, run `nuget install pythonx86 -Source %cd% -OutputDirectory target\installation\directory`

### PowerShell
For 64-bit Python, run `nuget install python -Source $(Get-Location) -OutputDirectory target\installation\directory`

For 32-bit Python, run `nuget install pythonx86 -Source $(Get-Location) -OutputDirectory target\installation\directory`
