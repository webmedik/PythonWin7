## All Versions

- Build from a path that doesn't contain spaces. Otherwise, you may get an error 9009 when executing `gendef`.
- Set `PATCHDIR` to the location of a release downloaded from https://github.com/nalexandru/api-ms-win-core-path-HACK. This folder should contain `x86\api-ms-win-core-path-l1-1-0.dll` and `x64\api-ms-win-core-path-l1-1-0.dll`.

## Python 3.9

- If you get an error during documentation build saying that `itircl.dll` was not registered correctly, go to `externals\windows-installer\htmlhelp` and run `regsvr32 itcc.dll`. Or you can install HTML Help Compiler system-wide, which would register this DLL anyway.
- Install Sphinx 3.5.4 to a Python 3.6 venv and set `PYTHON` to the location of the Python executable.
- Apply `add-dll-1.patch` to ensure that `api-ms-win-core-path-l1-1-0.dll` is installed next to the Python executable.
- Apply `enable-win7-install-1.patch` for 3.9.0-3.9.10 or `enable-win7-install-2.patch` for 3.9.11 or higher to allow the installer to proceed on Windows 7 and to include debug symbols, debug binaries, and the Universal CRT in the installer.
- Apply `fix-libffi-1.patch` for 3.9.0, `fix-libffi-2.patch` for 3.9.1, `fix-libffi-3.patch` for 3.9.2, `fix-libffi-4.patch` for 3.9.4, or `fix-libffi-5.patch` for 3.9.5-3.9.6 to avoid error where `libffi-7.lib` can't be found (https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/27982).
- Apply `fix-guid.patch` for 3.9.7 and higher to work around https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/96729.
- Apply `fix-htmlhelp.patch` for 3.9.0-3.9.10 to fix error in documentation build (https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/90621).
- Apply `fix-chm.patch` to fix formatting errors in the `.chm` help file (https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/91207).
- Run `buildrelease.bat -x86 -x64`.

## Python 3.10

- If you get an error during documentation build saying that `itircl.dll` was not registered correctly, go to `externals\windows-installer\htmlhelp` and run `regsvr32 itcc.dll`. Or you can install HTML Help Compiler system-wide, which would register this DLL anyway.
